Project: D-sub connectors(KiCad E.D.A. 8.0.2):

1. **Key Features & Technical Details:**  
   There are in this folder the codes of the test program, which implement two types of tests:

   - **Modular Connectivity:**  
       The board features multiple standard D-sub connectors (DB25 and DA15 plugs) as well as general-purpose headers (Conn_02x08, Conn_02x14).      
   - **Comprehensive Monitoring & Control:**  
       The schematic details connections for a wide range of control and monitoring signals. These include:
     - HV On/Off Control/Monitor
     - Voltage Setting/Monitor
     - Current Setting/Monitor
     - Interlock Control/Monitor
     - Fault Monitor
     - Mains Monitor
     - Remote Control
   - **Modular Connectivity:**  
       The inclusion of signals like Copy of local Voltage Setting and dedicated interlock monitors highlights a design focused on high-reliability industrial or scientific control systems. The board itself operates at a safe +10V power rail and does not process high voltages internally.
3. **Project Contents:**
   
   - Schematic: Circuit design of the pulse-generator module
   
   - Footprint: Custom pads and mechanical definitions
  
   - Layout: Routed two-layer board with structured design
  
   - 3D Model: Visual representation of the assembled board

5. **Software & Design Tools:**  
   The entire design was developed using software KiCad E.D.A. 8.0.2, which ensures the traceability and adaptability of the schematic.
